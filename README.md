# Systemedic
Systemedic is a wearable, non-invasive health monitoring device incorporating heart rate, blood oxygen level and skin temperature sensors that wirelessly streams data in real-time to a web application. Health facilities will lend the device to patients to monitor them from their homes either while they are receiving treatment or recovering from illness or injury.
It may also be used to monitor elderly people to allow early detection of underlying conditions or to rapidly respond to critical incidents such as strokes or heart attacks.
